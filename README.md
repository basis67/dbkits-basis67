# Basis67 DBKits - A Database Scaffolding Project

This is a Java infrastructure project from China.

You may have faced challenges when building Spring Boot frameworks from scratch:

- If you're a **beginner**, you might not know where to start
- If you're launching a **new business**, you might not have the time to design a robust database architecture for long-term maintainability

Basis67 DBKits is an open-source project created to solve these problems â€” a complete Spring Boot example project that includes database services and a code generator.

## About Commercial Licensing
We plan to introduce commercial licensing after further evaluating our project's security requirements and suitability for various business scenarios.

For now, you are welcome to use this project for:
- Learning and research
- Rapid prototyping
- Reference for your own scaffolding projects

## Supports MySQL & MongoDB
Choose the most suitable database type based on your business needs.

> [!NOTE] Quick Guide for Beginners
